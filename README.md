# Bike_Sales_Analysis
This project aims to analyze bike sales data from three major regions: Europe, North America, and the Pacific. Using Excel, we perform basic cleaning and processing tasks, commonly referred to as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), and build an interactive dashboard to provide insights and answer specific business questions.
